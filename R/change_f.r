#' Specify fishing mortality (\emph{F}) using the Stock Synthesis control file
#'
#' Replace or input fishing mortality (\emph{F}) for a Stock Synthesis (SS)
#' simulation via changes to the control file. \emph{F} for multiple fleets
#' and or seasons can be specified using list structures. If fishing only
#' occurs within a single fleet, then vector inputs are acceptable.
#'
#' @details
#' The argument \code{years} is the only argument that must be a vector
#' or a list of vectors. Other arguments can be specified using a single
#' scalar value that will be repeated for all fisheries in all years.
#' If the input argument needs to be different for any year or fishery, the
#' argument must be a list with vectors for each fishery, where each vector
#' is the same length as the vectors within the \code{years} argument. Although,
#' both the \code{years} and other input arguments can be specified using a single
#' vector if the length of {\code{fleets}} is just one or a vector of values
#' is specified for fleets because all of these vectors will just be combined
#' into a single data frame. Where it gets complicated is when there are
#' mutliple fleet and year combinations, then it is best to just use the list
#' structure common to other functions within \pkg{ss3sim}.
#'
#' \code{change_f} overrides any \emph{F} values that are in the supplied
#' control file with the newly specified values, i.e., \code{fvals}.
#' Users do not need to specify values for years in which there
#' will be zero fishing because SS will automatically set them to zero when
#' running the operating model.
#' Using the control file rather than the par file to manipulate the
#' operating model requires a few other files within the operating
#' model folder to be set up in a particular manner. That is,
#' (1) the starter file must be set up to read parameters from the control file
#' rather than the par file and
#' (2) the data file must have a dummy catch entry for every year, fishery
#' combination that will be specified in the control file. If a year, fishery
#' combination is specified in the control file and not present in the data file,
#' then the entry in the control file will be ignored. ss3sim automatically corrects
#' for this using \code{\link{change_data}} within \code{\link{ss3sim_base}} by
#' specifying a row for every year and fleet combination possible.

#' @template lcomp-agecomp-index
#' @param fisheries A deprecated argument that was replaced by \code{fleets} to
#' match the style of other ss3sim functions. Currently, it can still be used
#' to allow for back compatibility with the specification of which fleet the
#' fishing mortality pertains to. A vector the same lengths as \code{years}
#' or a single integer value is acceptable.
#' @param fvals A list of the same length as \code{fleets} with one
#' entry per fishing mortality level (\emph{F}) entry in \code{years}.
#' A single value will be repeated for every value in \code{years}. If more than
#' one fleet is present, then the single value will be used for all fleets, i.e.,
#' there is no way to map a single value to each year specific to the given fleet.
#' Instead you would need to provide a list of vectors of repeated values.
#' @param seasons A list of seasons to be entered into the
#' SS control file for each fleet.
#' The structure is the same as \code{fvals}, i.e., a list or a scalar.
#' The default is 1, which will be applied to all fleets in all years.
#' @param ses A list of fishing level standard errors (ses) to be entered into the
#' SS control file for each fleet.
#' The structure is the same as \code{fvals}, i.e., a list or a scalar.
#' The default is 0.005, which will be applied to all fleets in all years.
